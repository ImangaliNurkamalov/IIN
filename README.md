# IIN
Checking the correctness of IIN(Individual Identification Number) and sending it on emails. 

IIN is verified based on a special algorithm from the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan

Emails could be automatically sent using a task scheduler(windows). 
Limitation: since Google has changed the privacy concerns, emails can be sent only from corporative accounts. For regular accounts, I didn't find the solution
